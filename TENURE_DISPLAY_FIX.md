# Tenure Display Format Fix

## Problem
The tenure was being displayed in decimal format (e.g., "0.065840155754555 month") instead of a human-readable format (e.g., "Less than 1 month" or "6 months").

## Root Cause
The backend was calculating tenure in months with high precision (decimal), but when displaying:
- For employees with < 12 months tenure, it was directly using the decimal value
- This resulted in confusing displays like "0.065840155754555 month"

## Solution

### Backend Fix (`LeaveRequestController.php`)

**Updated `getLeaveSummary()` method**:

1. **Added rounding for display purposes**:
```php
$tenureInMonths = LeaveRequest::calculateEmployeeTenure($user->id);
$tenureInMonthsRounded = round($tenureInMonths); // Round to nearest integer
$tenureYears = floor($tenureInMonthsRounded / 12);
$remainingMonths = $tenureInMonthsRounded % 12;
```

2. **Improved display format logic**:
```php
'display' => $tenureYears > 0 
    ? "{$tenureYears} year" . ($tenureYears > 1 ? 's' : '') . 
      ($remainingMonths > 0 ? " and {$remainingMonths} month" . ($remainingMonths > 1 ? 's' : '') : '')
    : ($tenureInMonthsRounded == 0 
        ? "Less than 1 month" 
        : "{$tenureInMonthsRounded} month" . ($tenureInMonthsRounded > 1 ? 's' : ''))
```

## Display Examples

### Before Fix
| Actual Tenure | Display (OLD) | Issue |
|---------------|---------------|-------|
| 0.06 months | "0.065840155754555 month" | Confusing decimal |
| 0.5 months | "0.5 month" | Still decimal |
| 6.1 months | "6.1071055975792 month" | Unnecessary precision |
| 14.2 months | "1 year and 2.2 months" | Decimal in months |

### After Fix
| Actual Tenure | Display (NEW) | Benefit |
|---------------|---------------|---------|
| 0.06 months | "Less than 1 month" | Clear |
| 0.5 months | "1 month" | Rounded |
| 6.1 months | "6 months" | Clean integer |
| 14.2 months | "1 year and 2 months" | Proper format |

## Affected Areas

### 1. Leave Request Form - Payment Validation Modal

**Before**:
```
Based on your tenure (0.065840155754555 month), all 17 days will be WITHOUT PAY.
```

**After**:
```
Based on your tenure (Less than 1 month), all 17 days will be WITHOUT PAY.
```

### 2. Leave Request Form - Tenure Display

**Before**:
```
Your Tenure: 0.065840155754555 month
```

**After**:
```
Your Tenure: Less than 1 month
```

### 3. Employee Dashboard - Leave Summary

**Before**:
```
Tenure: 6.1071055975792 months
```

**After**:
```
Tenure: 6 months
```

## API Response Structure

The `getLeaveSummary()` endpoint now returns:

```json
{
  "tenure": {
    "months": 0.065840155754555,           // Exact decimal (for calculations)
    "months_rounded": 0,                    // Rounded integer
    "years": 0,
    "remaining_months": 0,
    "bracket": "Less than 6 months",
    "display": "Less than 1 month"          // Human-readable format
  }
}
```

**Key Fields**:
- `months`: Exact decimal value (used for precise calculations internally)
- `months_rounded`: Rounded to nearest integer
- `display`: **Human-readable string** (used in UI)

## Special Cases

### Case 1: Less than 1 month
- Exact: 0.06 months
- Rounded: 0 months
- Display: **"Less than 1 month"**

### Case 2: Exactly 1 month
- Exact: 1.0 months
- Rounded: 1 month
- Display: **"1 month"**

### Case 3: Multiple months (< 1 year)
- Exact: 6.1 months
- Rounded: 6 months
- Display: **"6 months"**

### Case 4: Exactly 1 year
- Exact: 12.0 months
- Rounded: 12 months
- Years: 1, Remaining: 0
- Display: **"1 year"**

### Case 5: Year + months
- Exact: 14.2 months
- Rounded: 14 months
- Years: 1, Remaining: 2
- Display: **"1 year and 2 months"**

### Case 6: Multiple years
- Exact: 25.8 months
- Rounded: 26 months
- Years: 2, Remaining: 2
- Display: **"2 years and 2 months"**

## Why Keep Decimal Value?

The exact decimal tenure (`months`) is still returned in the API because:
1. **Precise calculations**: Backend uses exact value for determining tenure brackets
2. **Threshold checks**: 6-month and 12-month thresholds need precise values
3. **Future needs**: May need exact tenure for other calculations

**Example**:
- Actual tenure: 5.9 months â†’ Display: "6 months" (rounded)
- But for entitlement: Still **< 6 months**, so gets 0 paid days (not 3)

## Benefits

### âœ… **User-Friendly**
- No confusing decimals
- Clear, readable format
- Natural language ("Less than 1 month")

### âœ… **Consistent**
- All tenure displays use same format
- Matches how HR typically communicates tenure

### âœ… **Accurate**
- Rounding is only for display
- Calculations still use exact values
- No loss of precision where it matters

### âœ… **Professional**
- Looks polished and professional
- Easier to understand at a glance
- Better user experience

## Testing

### Test Scenarios

1. **New Hire (< 1 month)**:
   - Expected: "Less than 1 month"
   - Entitlement: 0 paid days

2. **6-Month Employee**:
   - Expected: "6 months"
   - Entitlement: 3 SIL paid days

3. **1-Year Employee**:
   - Expected: "1 year" or "1 year and X months"
   - Entitlement: 8 SIL paid days

4. **Multi-Year Employee**:
   - Expected: "2 years and 3 months"
   - Entitlement: Full benefits

## Rollout

**No frontend changes required!**

The frontend already uses `tenure.display` from the backend. Once the backend is updated:
1. âœ… All leave request forms automatically show correct format
2. âœ… All employee dashboards update automatically
3. âœ… All tenure displays across the system are fixed

**Just refresh the browser** after backend deployment.

## Summary

The tenure display has been improved to show user-friendly, rounded values:
- **"Less than 1 month"** instead of "0.065840155754555 month"
- **"6 months"** instead of "6.1071055975792 month"
- **"1 year and 2 months"** instead of "14.2 months"

All displays now use clean, professional formatting while maintaining calculation accuracy! ðŸŽ‰
