## 🎨 UI Layout

### **Before (No Department Filter)**
```
[Search (5 cols)]  [Year (3 cols)]  [Actions (4 cols)]
```

### **After (With Department Filter)**
```
[Search (4 cols)]  [Department (2 cols)]  [Year (2 cols)]  [Actions (4 cols)]
```

---

## 📊 How It Works

### 1. **Department Extraction**
```javascript
const departments = Array.from(new Set(
  leaveData
    .filter(emp => emp && emp.department)
    .map(emp => emp.department)
)).sort();
```

### 2. **Filtering Logic**
```javascript
const matchesDepartment = !selectedDepartment || department === selectedDepartment;
```
- If no department selected → Show all employees
- If department selected → Show only employees from that department

### 3. **Combined Filtering**
```javascript
return matchesSearch && matchesDepartment;
```
- Search filter AND Department filter must both match
- Allows searching within a specific department

### 4. **Dynamic Stats**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Recalculate stats when filters change
  calculateStats(filteredData);
}, [filteredData.length, searchTerm, selectedDepartment]);
```
