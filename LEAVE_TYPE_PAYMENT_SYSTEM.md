# Leave Type-Based Automatic Payment System

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the automatic leave payment system based on **leave types**. The system automatically determines "With Pay" and "Without Pay" status based on predefined limits for each leave type, eliminating manual HR intervention.

**Implementation Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Version**: 2.0.0  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## System Behavior

### ⚙️ Automatic With Pay Setup

The system automatically sets the maximum number of "With Pay" days based on the leave type selected by the employee.

| Leave Type | With Pay Days |
|------------|--------------|
| **Sick Leave** | 8 days |
| **Emergency Leave** | 8 days |
| **Vacation Leave** | 5 days |
| **Maternity Leave** | 105 days |
| **Paternity Leave** | 7 days |
| **VAWC Leave** | 10 days |
| **Women's Special Leave** | 10 days |
| **Parental Leave** | 7 days |

### 🔄 Automatic Conversion to Without Pay

When an employee requests leave beyond the allowed "With Pay" days for a specific leave type:
- **First N days** = With Pay (where N = max paid days for that type)
- **Remaining days** = Without Pay

**Example**:
```
Employee requests 10 days of Sick Leave:
→ First 8 days = With Pay
→ Remaining 2 days = Without Pay
```

### 📊 Leave Tracking

The system tracks:
1. **Used "With Pay" days** per leave type per employee per year
2. **Remaining "With Pay" days** for each leave type
3. **Percentage used** for visual progress bars
4. **Reset annually** on January 1st

### 🔔 User Notifications

Employees receive clear notifications about payment status:

1. **Before Submission**: Live balance display showing:
   - Current selected leave type balance
   - Remaining paid days
   - Visual progress bar
   - All leave types overview

2. **During Submission**: Warning message if split payment:
   ```
   💰 Payment Breakdown:
   ✅ 8 days WITH PAY
   ⚠️ 2 days WITHOUT PAY
   
   Only 8 days are with pay. The remaining 2 days will be without pay.
   ```

3. **After Submission**: Success message with payment breakdown

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Configuration File (`hrms-backend/config/leave.php`)

Added `with_pay_days` configuration:

```php
'with_pay_days' => [
    'Sick Leave' => 8,
    'Emergency Leave' => 8,
    'Vacation Leave' => 5,
    'Maternity Leave' => 105,
    'Paternity Leave' => 7,
    'Leave for Victims of Violence Against Women and Their Children (VAWC)' => 10,
    "Women's Special Leave" => 10,
    'Parental Leave' => 7,
    'Personal Leave' => 5,
    'Bereavement Leave' => 5,
],
```

#### 2. LeaveRequest Model (`hrms-backend/app/Models/LeaveRequest.php`)

**New Method**: `calculateAutomaticPaymentTerms($employeeId, $leaveType, $requestedDays, $currentYear)`

**Logic Flow**:
```
1. Get max with-pay days from config for leave type
2. Calculate used with-pay days for this leave type in current year
3. Calculate remaining with-pay days
4. Determine payment split:
   a. If remaining >= requested: All with pay
   b. If remaining > 0 but < requested: Split payment
   c. If remaining = 0: All without pay
5. Return payment terms with detailed breakdown
```

**Return Format**:
```php
[
    'with_pay_days' => int,           // Days that will be paid
    'without_pay_days' => int,        // Days that will be unpaid
    'terms' => 'with PAY|without PAY', // Overall status
    'message' => string,               // User-friendly message
    'max_with_pay' => int,             // Max allowed for this type
    'used_with_pay' => int,            // Already used this year
    'remaining_with_pay' => int,       // Still available
    'is_split' => bool                 // Whether payment is split
]
```

#### 3. LeaveRequestController (`hrms-backend/app/Http/Controllers/Api/LeaveRequestController.php`)

**Modified `store()` Method**:
```php
// Calculate automatic payment terms based on leave type
$paymentTerms = LeaveRequest::calculateAutomaticPaymentTerms(
    $user->id, 
    $validated['type'], 
    $totalDays
);

// Set terms automatically
$leaveRequest->terms = $paymentTerms['terms'];
$leaveRequest->leave_category = $paymentTerms['with_pay_days'] > 0 ? 
    "Paid: {$paymentTerms['with_pay_days']} days" : 
    "Unpaid: {$paymentTerms['without_pay_days']} days";
```

**Response includes**:
```json
{
  "message": "Leave request submitted successfully",
  "data": { ...leave request... },
  "warning": {
    "warning": true,
    "message": "Only 8 days are with pay...",
    "with_pay_days": 8,
    "without_pay_days": 2,
    "is_split": true
  }
}
```

**Updated `getLeaveSummary()` Method**:
```php
// Returns type-specific balances
'leave_type_balances' => [
    'Sick Leave' => [
        'max_with_pay_days' => 8,
        'used_with_pay_days' => 3,
        'remaining_with_pay_days' => 5,
        'percentage_used' => 37.5
    ],
    // ... other leave types
]
```

### Frontend Changes

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: First Sick Leave Request (5 days)

**Scenario**: Employee requests 5 days of Sick Leave (first time this year)

**System Behavior**:
```
Used sick leave with pay: 0/8 days
Requested: 5 days
Calculation: 8 - 0 = 8 remaining (enough for 5)
Result: All 5 days WITH PAY
```

**Employee Sees**:
```
✅ All 5 days will be with pay.
You have 8 paid days remaining for Sick Leave.
```

### Example 2: Second Sick Leave Request (5 more days)

**Scenario**: Same employee requests 5 more days of Sick Leave later

**System Behavior**:
```
Used sick leave with pay: 5/8 days
Requested: 5 days
Calculation: 8 - 5 = 3 remaining (not enough for 5)
Result: 3 days WITH PAY, 2 days WITHOUT PAY
```

**Employee Sees**:
```
⚠️ Payment Breakdown:
✅ 3 days WITH PAY
⚠️ 2 days WITHOUT PAY

Only 3 days are with pay. The remaining 2 days will be without pay.
You have used 5 of 8 paid days for Sick Leave this year.
```

### Example 3: Third Sick Leave Request (2 days)

**Scenario**: Same employee requests 2 more days of Sick Leave

**System Behavior**:
```
Used sick leave with pay: 8/8 days
Requested: 2 days
Calculation: 8 - 8 = 0 remaining
Result: All 2 days WITHOUT PAY
```

**Employee Sees**:
```
❌ All 2 days will be without pay.
You have already used all 8 paid days for Sick Leave this year.
```

### Example 4: Different Leave Type (Vacation Leave)

**Scenario**: Same employee requests 3 days of Vacation Leave

**System Behavior**:
```
Used vacation leave with pay: 0/5 days (independent counter)
Requested: 3 days
Calculation: 5 - 0 = 5 remaining (enough for 3)
Result: All 3 days WITH PAY
```

**Employee Sees**:
```
✅ All 3 days will be with pay.
You have 5 paid days remaining for Vacation Leave.
```

## Business Rules

### Leave Type Rules

1. **Type-Specific Limits**: Each leave type has its own "with pay" limit
2. **Independent Tracking**: Each leave type counter is tracked separately
3. **Annual Reset**: All counters reset to 0 on January 1st
4. **No Carryover**: Unused paid days don't carry over to next year

### Payment Calculation Rules

1. **First-Come-First-Served**: Paid days used in chronological order
2. **Split Automatically**: System automatically splits if request exceeds available paid days
3. **No Manual Override**: HR cannot manually change payment status
4. **Transparent**: Employee sees exact breakdown before and after submission

### Validation Rules

1. **Active Leave Check**: Cannot file if current leave not ended
2. **Type Validation**: Must select valid leave type from config
3. **Balance Check**: Shows warnings but allows submission even if no paid days left
4. **Date Validation**: Start date must be future, end date must be after start

---

## Configuration Management

### Adding a New Leave Type

To add a new leave type with payment tracking:

1. **Update Config** (`hrms-backend/config/leave.php`):
```php
'with_pay_days' => [
    // ... existing types
    'New Leave Type' => 10,  // Add new type with days
],
```

2. **Update Frontend Forms** (add to dropdown options):
```jsx
<option value="New Leave Type">New Leave Type</option>
```

3. **No Database Migration Required**: System uses config

### Modifying With-Pay Days

To change the number of paid days for a leave type:

1. Edit `hrms-backend/config/leave.php`
2. Change the value for the leave type
3. Restart backend server (if using cached config)
4. Changes apply immediately to new requests

**Note**: Existing approved leaves are not affected

## Testing Checklist

### Backend Testing

- [ ] Create leave with all paid days available
- [ ] Create leave with some paid days used
- [ ] Create leave with all paid days used
- [ ] Create leave exceeding paid days (split)
- [ ] Test different leave types independently
- [ ] Test annual reset (mock date to Jan 1)
- [ ] Test config changes take effect
- [ ] Test getLeaveSummary returns correct balances

### Frontend Testing

- [ ] Verify balance display for each leave type
- [ ] Test progress bar color changes (green/yellow/red)
- [ ] Test collapsible all-types overview
- [ ] Test split payment notification display
- [ ] Test leave type selection updates balance
- [ ] Test refresh button updates data
- [ ] Test active leave warning display
- [ ] Test HR modal shows read-only status

### Integration Testing

- [ ] Submit leave → verify payment status correct
- [ ] Submit multiple leaves → verify counters update
- [ ] Submit for different types → verify independence
- [ ] Submit across year boundary → verify reset
- [ ] Submit with split → verify notification shown
- [ ] Approve leave → verify balance decreases

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Balance Not Updating

**Cause**: Frontend cache not refreshing  
**Solution**: Click "Refresh Status" button or reload page

### Issue: Wrong Payment Status

**Cause**: Leave submitted before system update  
**Solution**: Old leaves use old rules (by design)

### Issue: Config Changes Not Applied

**Cause**: Laravel config cache  
**Solution**: Run `php artisan config:clear`

### Issue: Progress Bar Stuck

**Cause**: JavaScript calculation error  
**Solution**: Check browser console, verify API response

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Partial Day Support**: Track hours, not just full days
2. **Department-Specific Limits**: Different limits per department
3. **Position-Based Rules**: Senior staff get more paid days
4. **Carry-Over Feature**: Optional unused days carry to next year (up to limit)
5. **Email Notifications**: Alert employee when paid days running low
6. **Analytics Dashboard**: Visual reports of leave usage by type
7. **Predictive Warnings**: "At current rate, you'll run out by..."
8. **Leave Planning**: Calendar showing paid days availability
