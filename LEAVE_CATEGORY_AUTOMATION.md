# Leave Category Automation - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The leave category system has been updated to be **completely automatic** based on leave type. HR Assistants no longer manually set categories - they are determined automatically by the system.

## Automatic Category Assignment Rules

### Category Types
1. **Service Incentive Leave (SIL)**
   - Applies to: **Sick Leave** and **Emergency Leave**
   - These two leave types share the same paid days pool
   
2. **Emergency Leave (EL)**
   - Applies to: **All other leave types**
   - Includes: Vacation Leave, Maternity Leave, Paternity Leave, Personal Leave, Bereavement Leave, etc.

## Implementation Details

### Backend Logic
**File:** `hrms-backend/app/Models/LeaveRequest.php`

```php
public static function determineLeaveCategory($leaveType)
{
    // Sick Leave and Emergency Leave fall under SIL
    $silLeaveTypes = ['Sick Leave', 'Emergency Leave'];
    
    if (in_array($leaveType, $silLeaveTypes)) {
        return 'Service Incentive Leave (SIL)';
    }
    
    // All other leave types fall under Emergency Leave category
    return 'Emergency Leave (EL)';
}
```

**Automatic Assignment:** When a leave request is created, the `calculateAutomaticPaymentTerms()` method automatically:
1. Calculates employee tenure
2. Determines the appropriate category using `determineLeaveCategory()`
3. Returns the category in the payment terms array
4. Controller automatically sets `leave_category` field

### Frontend Changes
**File:** `hrms-frontend/src/components/HrAssistant/LeaveManagement.js`

**Before:**
- HR Assistant could manually select category from dropdown
- "Set Category" modal with manual selection
- "Save Category" button to persist changes

**After:**
- Category automatically displayed directly in the Terms column
- No button needed - category shown below the payment status text
- Plain text display for payment status (with PAY / without PAY)
- üìã SIL icon for Sick Leave & Emergency Leave
- Plain text "Emergency Leave" for all other leave types (no icon)
- Clean, minimal design with 13px bold font
- At-a-glance visibility without any clicking required

### Display in UI

**Leave Management Table:**

**Leave Type Column:**
```
Sick Leave
(Service Incentive Leave (SIL))  ‚Üê Automatic category display
```

**Terms Column (With Pay/Without Pay):**
```
with PAY                         ‚Üê Payment status (13px, bold)
üìã SIL                           ‚Üê Category display (13px, bold)

OR

with PAY                         ‚Üê Payment status (13px, bold)
Emergency Leave                  ‚Üê Category display (13px, bold)
```

**In-Table Category Display:**
The category is prominently displayed directly in the Terms column for immediate visibility, eliminating the need for modals or additional clicks.

## Tenure-Based Payment Integration

The automatic category assignment works hand-in-hand with tenure-based payment:

| Tenure | SIL (Sick & Emergency) | Other Leave Types |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------|
| < 6 months | WITHOUT PAY | WITHOUT PAY |
| 6-12 months | 3 days WITH PAY | WITHOUT PAY |
| 1+ year | 8 days WITH PAY | WITH PAY (based on type) |

## Benefits

1. **Consistency:** Categories are always assigned correctly based on leave type
2. **No Manual Errors:** HR cannot accidentally assign wrong category
3. **Simplified Workflow:** HR doesn't need to manually set categories
4. **Transparency:** Employees and HR can clearly see how categories are determined
5. **Automatic SIL Pooling:** Sick Leave and Emergency Leave automatically share the same paid days pool

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `hrms-backend/app/Models/LeaveRequest.php`
  - `determineLeaveCategory()` method already existed
  - `calculateAutomaticPaymentTerms()` returns `leave_category`
  
- `hrms-backend/app/Http/Controllers/Api/LeaveRequestController.php`
  - `store()` method automatically sets category on creation
  - Category is returned in `getLeaveSummary()` endpoint

### Frontend
- `hrms-frontend/src/components/HrAssistant/LeaveManagement.js`
  - Changed modal from editable to informational
  - Updated button from "Set Category" to "View Category"
  - Removed manual category selection dropdown
  - Removed "Save Category" functionality
  - Added clear explanation of automatic assignment

## Testing Notes

1. **Create Sick Leave:** Should automatically assign "Service Incentive Leave (SIL)"
2. **Create Emergency Leave:** Should automatically assign "Service Incentive Leave (SIL)"
3. **Create Vacation Leave:** Should automatically assign "Emergency Leave (EL)"
4. **Create Maternity Leave:** Should automatically assign "Emergency Leave (EL)"
5. **View Category in HR Portal:** Should show as informational modal with automatic assignment explanation

## Migration Notes

**Existing Leaves:** Leaves created before this update may have different category values or no category. The system will:
- Display existing category if present
- Show "Not yet assigned" if category is null
- New leaves will always have automatic category assignment

**No Data Migration Required:** The automatic logic will apply to all new leave requests going forward.
