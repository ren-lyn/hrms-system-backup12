## 💻 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **ManagerDashboard.js**
   - Added `leaveMenuOpen` state to track dropdown
   - Modified `handleNavigation` to toggle dropdown on Leave Request click
   - Added dropdown menu HTML with two submenu items
   - Updated `renderContent` to handle new view types
   - Added imports for Eye and BarChart2 icons

2. **ManagerLeaveManagement.js**
   - Added `viewType` prop to component
   - Conditional rendering based on viewType:
     - `viewType === 'status'` → Show Leave Overview
     - `viewType === 'tracker'` → Show Leave Tracker
     - Default → Show standard Leave Management (backwards compatible)
   - Removed sidebar code (no longer needed)

### Code Structure

```javascript
// State management
const [leaveMenuOpen, setLeaveMenuOpen] = useState(false);
const [activeView, setActiveView] = useState('dashboard');

// Navigation handler
const handleNavigation = (view, label) => {
  if (view === 'leave-request') {
    setLeaveMenuOpen(!leaveMenuOpen);  // Toggle dropdown
    return;
  }
  setActiveView(view);
};

// Render content based on active view
case 'leave-status':
  return <ManagerLeaveManagement viewType="status" />;
case 'leave-tracker':
  return <ManagerLeaveManagement viewType="tracker" />;
```
