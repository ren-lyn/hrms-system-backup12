# UI Holiday Type Display Update

## Overview
Added a "Holiday Type" column to the attendance dashboard table to display holiday information imported from Excel/CSV files.

## Update Date
October 19, 2025

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes

**File**: `hrms-frontend/src/components/HrAssistant/AttendanceDashboard.js`

1. **Added "Holiday Type" column header** to the attendance table
2. **Added Holiday Type data cell** that displays:
   - The holiday type value from the import (stored in `remarks` field)
   - Shows "--" if no holiday type is present
   - Hides "Auto-marked during import" remarks (internal system message)

### Backend Changes

**File**: `hrms-backend/app/Services/AttendanceImportService.php`

1. **Updated remarks field priority** in `processEmployeeDayPunchGroup()`:
   - First priority: `holiday_type` (from Holiday Type column)
   - Second priority: `verify_type` (legacy)
   - Third priority: `source` (legacy)

This ensures that when a Holiday Type is provided in the import file, it gets stored in the `remarks` field and displayed in the UI.

## How It Works

### Import Flow
1. HR Assistant uploads Excel/CSV file with "Holiday Type" column
2. System reads the holiday_type value for each row
3. System stores holiday_type in the `remarks` field of the attendance record
4. System uses holiday_type to determine status (Holiday Worked/No Work)

### Display Flow
1. Frontend fetches attendance records from API
2. API returns `remarks` field containing the holiday type
3. UI displays the holiday type in the "Holiday Type" column
4. If no holiday type exists, shows "--"

## Table Layout

The attendance table now displays:

| Employee ID | Name | Date | Day | Time-in | Time-out | Status | Holiday Type | Total Hours |
|-------------|------|------|-----|---------|----------|--------|--------------|-------------|
| 1001 | John Doe | Oct 16 | Monday | -- | -- | Holiday (No Work) | Regular Holiday | -- |
| 1002 | Jane Smith | Oct 16 | Monday | 08:00 AM | 05:00 PM | Holiday (Worked) | Special Holiday | 8h |
| 1003 | Bob Johnson | Oct 17 | Tuesday | 08:00 AM | 05:00 PM | Present | -- | 8h |

## Example Data

### With Holiday Type
```json
{
  "employee_id": 1001,
  "date": "2025-10-16",
  "clock_in": null,
  "clock_out": null,
  "status": "Holiday (No Work)",
  "remarks": "Regular Holiday",
  "total_hours": 0
}
```

**Display**: Shows "Regular Holiday" in the Holiday Type column

### Without Holiday Type
```json
{
  "employee_id": 1003,
  "date": "2025-10-17",
  "clock_in": "08:00:00",
  "clock_out": "17:00:00",
  "status": "Present",
  "remarks": null,
  "total_hours": 8
}
```

**Display**: Shows "--" in the Holiday Type column

### Auto-Marked Absent
```json
{
  "employee_id": 1004,
  "date": "2025-10-18",
  "clock_in": null,
  "clock_out": null,
  "status": "Absent",
  "remarks": "Auto-marked during import",
  "total_hours": 0
}
```

**Display**: Shows "--" in the Holiday Type column (system remarks are hidden)

## CSV Export

The CSV export already includes the "Remarks" column which contains the holiday type:

```csv
Employee ID,Employee Name,Department,Position,Date,Clock In,Clock Out,Break Out,Break In,Total Hours,Overtime Hours,Undertime Hours,Status,Remarks
1001,John Doe,IT,Developer,2025-10-16,,,,,0.00,0.00,0.00,Holiday (No Work),Regular Holiday
1002,Jane Smith,HR,Manager,2025-10-16,08:00:00,17:00:00,,,8.00,0.00,0.00,Holiday (Worked),Special Holiday
```

## UI Styling

- **Holiday Type column**: Displays in small, muted, italic text
- **Empty values**: Shows "--" in muted text
- **System remarks**: Hidden from display (e.g., "Auto-marked during import")

## Benefits

1. **Visibility**: HR can see what type of holiday each date represents
2. **Audit Trail**: Holiday types are preserved from import for reference
3. **Clarity**: Easy to distinguish between different holiday types
4. **Export**: Holiday types are included in CSV exports

## Usage Example

### Import File
```excel
| Employee ID | Name | Date | Time-in | Time-out | Holiday Type | Status |
|-------------|------|------|---------|----------|--------------|--------|
| 1001 | John Doe | 2025-10-16 | | | Regular Holiday | Holiday (No Work) |
| 1002 | Jane Smith | 2025-10-16 | 08:00 | 17:00 | Special Holiday | Holiday (Worked) |
```

### Result in UI Table
The table will display the holiday types in the new "Holiday Type" column:
- John Doe: Shows "Regular Holiday"
- Jane Smith: Shows "Special Holiday"

## Technical Notes

1. **Field Mapping**: Holiday Type from import → `remarks` field in database → Holiday Type column in UI
2. **Priority**: If both holiday_type and verify_type exist, holiday_type takes precedence
3. **Filtering**: System remarks like "Auto-marked during import" are not displayed
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Works with existing data; shows "--" for records without holiday type

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Separate `holiday_type` database column for better data structure
2. Holiday type dropdown filter in the UI
3. Holiday type statistics in the dashboard
4. Color-coding different holiday types
5. Holiday type management interface
