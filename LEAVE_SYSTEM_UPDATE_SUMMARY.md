# Leave Payment System Update Summary

## üîÑ System Change Overview

The leave payment system has been **completely redesigned** from an instance-based system to a **leave-type-based system**.

---

## Previous System (Instance-Based)

### How It Worked
- Employees got **3 leave instances per year**
- **First instance**: With Pay (up to 7 days)
- **Second/Third instances**: Without Pay
- All leave types treated the same way

### Problems
- Not flexible enough
- Didn't account for different leave type needs
- Employee confusion about "instances"
- 7-day limit too restrictive for some types

---

## New System (Leave-Type-Based) ‚úÖ

### How It Works
- Each **leave type** has specific "with pay" days per year
- Tracks usage **per leave type**
- Different allowances for different needs
- Annual reset on January 1st

### With-Pay Days by Leave Type

| Leave Type | With Pay Days |
|-----------|---------------|
| Sick Leave | 8 days |
| Emergency Leave | 8 days |
| Vacation Leave | 5 days |
| Maternity Leave | 105 days |
| Paternity Leave | 7 days |
| VAWC Leave | 10 days |
| Women's Special Leave | 10 days |
| Parental Leave | 7 days |

---

## Key Changes

### 1. Calculation Method

**Before**:
```
Count leave instances ‚Üí 1st = paid, 2nd/3rd = unpaid
```

**Now**:
```
For each leave type:
  Track used paid days
  Compare with type-specific limit
  Calculate split if needed
```

### 2. Employee Experience

**Before**:
```
"You have 2 leave instances remaining"
‚Üí Confusing
```

**Now**:
```
Sick Leave: 3 / 8 paid days remaining
Vacation Leave: 5 / 5 paid days remaining
‚Üí Clear per-type balance
```

### 3. UI Display

**Before**:
- Single counter showing leave instances
- Generic message about payment status

**Now**:
- **Live balance display** per selected leave type
- **Progress bars** showing usage
- **All leave types** in collapsible overview
- **Split payment warnings** before submission

### 4. Backend Logic

**Before** (`calculateAutomaticPaymentTerms`):
- Required parameters: `$employeeId`, `$requestedDays`
- Counted leave instances
- Applied 7-day rule

**Now** (`calculateAutomaticPaymentTerms`):
- Required parameters: `$employeeId`, `$leaveType`, `$requestedDays`
- Checks type-specific config
- Tracks per-type usage
- Applies type-specific limits

## Migration Notes

### Backward Compatibility

‚úÖ **Existing leaves**: Old leaves with "TBD by HR" remain unchanged  
‚úÖ **API structure**: Existing endpoints work the same  
‚úÖ **Database**: No schema changes required  
‚úÖ **Frontend**: Gracefully handles missing data

### What Changed

‚ùå **Instance tracking**: No longer track "leave instances"  
‚úÖ **Type tracking**: Now track per-type usage  
‚ùå **7-day rule**: No longer applies  
‚úÖ **Type-specific rules**: Different limits per type  
‚ùå **Generic messages**: No longer "first/second/third leave"  
‚úÖ **Type-specific messages**: Now per-type balance info

---

## Examples Comparison

### Example: 10-Day Sick Leave

**Previous System**:
```
If 1st leave: First 7 days paid, 3 days unpaid
If 2nd leave: All 10 days unpaid
```

**New System**:
```
Check sick leave balance:
- If 8+ days remaining: First 8 paid, 2 unpaid
- If 5 days remaining: First 5 paid, 5 unpaid
- If 0 days remaining: All 10 unpaid
```

### Example: Multiple Leave Types

**Previous System**:
```
1st leave (Sick, 5 days): All paid
2nd leave (Vacation, 3 days): All unpaid ‚ùå
‚Üí Vacation penalized for using sick leave
```

**New System**:
```
Sick leave (5 days): All paid (3/8 used)
Vacation leave (3 days): All paid (3/5 used) ‚úÖ
‚Üí Independent tracking per type
```
