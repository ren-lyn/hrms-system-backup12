# Calendar Real-Time Update - Quick Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. No More Redirects to Cancel Form
- When you click the "Cancel Event" button, the system now shows a **confirmation modal** instead of redirecting
- After confirming, a **success validation modal** appears with the message: "Cancellation successful!"
- You stay on the same page - no navigation away from the calendar

### 2. Real-Time Updates Across All User Roles
When an HR Assistant cancels an event, the update is now visible to:
- ‚úÖ **HR Assistants** - Immediate update
- ‚úÖ **Employees** - Updated within 30 seconds or on tab focus
- ‚úÖ **Managers** - Updated within 30 seconds or on tab focus
- ‚úÖ **Staff** - Updated within 30 seconds or on tab focus

### 3. Auto-Refresh Mechanisms
All calendar views now automatically refresh in two ways:

#### a) Window Focus Detection
- When you switch back to a calendar tab, it automatically checks for updates
- Ensures you always see fresh data when returning to the calendar

#### b) Periodic Refresh
- Calendars automatically refresh every **30 seconds**
- Runs silently in the background without disrupting your work
- Updates are seamless - no loading spinners

### 4. Visual Update Indicator
- All calendars now show a "Last updated: [time]" indicator in the top right
- Helps you know when the data was last refreshed
- Updates automatically as data refreshes

## üéØ User Experience Flow

### When HR Cancels an Event:

**Step 1:** Click on the yellow event box (e.g., "9:15 PM")
- Event details modal opens

**Step 2:** Click "Cancel Event" button
- Confirmation modal appears: "Are you sure you want to cancel this event?"
- Shows how many employees will be notified

**Step 3:** Confirm cancellation
- **No redirect** - you stay on the calendar
- Success modal pops up: "Cancellation successful! X employee(s) have been notified and all calendars have been updated."
- Event immediately shows as "CANCELLED" with gray background

**Step 4:** Real-time sync
- All calendar caches are cleared
- Other users see the update within 30 seconds (or immediately if they switch tabs)

## üìä Visual Changes

### Cancelled Events Now Display:
- **Gray background** instead of colored (yellow, blue, etc.)
- **60% opacity** to indicate inactive status
- **"CANCELLED" badge** clearly visible
- Event remains visible for record-keeping

### Calendar Header Now Shows:
```
Last updated: 2:45:30 PM
[Today] [New Event]
```

## üîß Technical Details

### Files Modified:
1. `hrms-frontend/src/api/calendar.js` - Added cache clearing utility
2. `hrms-frontend/src/components/HrAssistant/MyCalendar.js` - Enhanced cancellation + auto-refresh
3. `hrms-frontend/src/components/Employee/EmployeeCalendar.js` - Auto-refresh + last updated
4. `hrms-frontend/src/components/Manager/ManagerCalendar.js` - Auto-refresh + last updated
5. `hrms-frontend/src/components/HrAssistant/StaffCalendar.js` - Auto-refresh + last updated

### Cache Management:
- When an event is cancelled, **all calendar caches** are cleared
- This ensures fresh data is fetched on next load
- Prevents stale data from showing

### Performance:
- **30-second refresh interval** - balanced between real-time and server load
- **Silent updates** - no loading spinners during auto-refresh
- **Cached data shown first** - fresh data fetched in background

## üß™ Testing Checklist

   - [x] Click on an event
   - [x] Click "Cancel Event"
   - [x] Confirm in the modal
   - [x] Verify success modal appears (no redirect)

   - [x] Check "Last updated" time appears in header

2. **As Employee/Manager:**
   - [x] Wait 30 seconds after HR cancels event
   - [x] Calendar should automatically show cancelled event

3. **Cross-Browser Testing:**

## üìù Usage Notes
